# SYSTEM REQUIREMENT:
1. NetBeans IDE
2. Oracle for the Port Number.

# WORKING
If you want to see the UI of the project then you can double click the jar file. but if you want to test full working project then you need to have Netbeans IDE  and Oracle in your system, where you have to edit the port number according to your system for it to work.
If the entered port number doesn't matches with your system, then the program won't connect to database.
